## Introduction
RemoteUp is a remote jobs board portal where jobseekers can save & apply for jobs and recruiters can post jobs. It helps recruiters with an inbuilt ATS(Applicants Tracking System) at no extra cost.

Making this site gave us the opportunity to really stretch out and craft a site with great UX.

Welcome! we hope you enjoy the site as much as we enjoyed making it.

## Technology Stack
We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)

<br/>

## Installation
- Fork or directly clone this repository to your local machine
